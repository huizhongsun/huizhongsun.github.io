- Between the Object Language and the Metalanguage<br><br> 

Metalanguage is words or symbols for talking about the object language. In logic and linguistics, a metalanguage is a language used to make statements about statements in the object language. It can be seen as a field of meaning that gives one the power to communicate in a given language. <br><br>

 In a natural language there is an infinite regress of metalanguages, each with more specialized vocabulary and simpler syntax. Designating the language now as L0, the grammar of the language is a discourse in the metalanguage L1, which is a sublanguage nested within L0. The grammar of L1, which has the form of a factual description, is a discourse in the metametalanguage L2, which is also a sublanguage of L0. The grammar of L2, which has the form of a theory describing the syntactic structure of such factual descriptions, is stated in the metametametalanguage L3, which likewise is a sublanguage of L0. The grammar of L3 has the form of a metatheory describing the syntactic structure of theories stated in L2. L4 and succeeding metalanguages have the same grammar as L3, differing only in reference. Since all of these metalanguages are sublanguages of L0, L1 is a nested metalanguage, but L2 and sequel are ordered metalanguages. Since all these metalanguages are sublanguages of L0 they are all embedded languages with respect to the language as a whole.
