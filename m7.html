<h4> Chaos and Fractals </h4>
<p>
	the atmosphere is chaotic. All these little differences and errors I mentioned above, they might not seem all that significant. Maybe you don't care whether or not the model predicts rainfall down to the millimeter, or the temperature to within a degree. Why can't we even get basic questions like "will it rain three days from now?" correct? The answer is in chaos. The atmosphere behaves in such a way that small differences add up over time. It's often explained in terms of the Butterfly Effect; a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil might be the difference that creates a hurricane in Gulf of Mexico a month or two later. And this isn't really an analogy, it is mathematically true: the extreme non-linearity (chaos) of the equations that govern the motion of air means that something that small can lead to huge differences weeks and months down the road. Even if you had a perfect forecasting model, and perfect observations of the atmosphere from weather stations placed 1 meter apart for the entire depth of the atmosphere, you still could not predict whether or not it would rain a month from now. That's how chaotic the atmosphere is.
