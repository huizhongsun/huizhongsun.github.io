<h4>Body and Mind in a Place</h4>

<p>
For Nietzche, the Dionysian spirit is driven by the excess of energy. This superfluity of force, expressed in rhythmic dance, was enacted within a space, which was in its turn animated by that activity. "The world...set in a definite space as a definite force, and not a space that might be "empty" here or there, but rather as force throughout, as a play of forces and waves of forces, at the same time one and many, increasing here and at the same time decreasing there."
