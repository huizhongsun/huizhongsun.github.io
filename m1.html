<p>
- A Matrix as A Transformation<br><br>
A transformation can refers to description of the same object as viewed from two different vector space(change of basis).<br>

In the active transformation (left), a point moves from position P to P' by rotating clockwise by an angle θ about the origin of the coordinate system. In the passive transformation (right), point P does not move, while the coordinate system rotates counterclockwise by an angle θ about its origin. The coordinates of P' in the active case (that is, relative to the original coordinate system) are the same as the coordinates of P relative to the rotated coordinate system.
