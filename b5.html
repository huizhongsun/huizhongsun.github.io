- The Architectural Promenade<br><br>
The "promenade architecturale" – the observer’s pathway through the built space – is a central element of Le Corbusier’s architectural and city planning designs. It is the sequence of images that unfolds before the eyes of the observer as he or she gradually advances through the structure. It is the creation of a hierarchy among the architectural events, a set of instructions for reading the work – the "internal circulatory system" of architecture. With the help of the "promenade architecturale", Le Corbusier created virtuosic imbrications of indoor and outdoor space, fluid spaces that reveal themselves as the visitor progresses. Architecture constitutes the space of processes of movement.
