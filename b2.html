<p>The MÃ¼ller House (Prague) - Adolf Loos</p>
<h4>Raumplan versus Plan Libre</h4>


<p>
- The Domestic Scene<br><br>

In the Muller house, the sequence of spaces, articulated around the staircase, follows an increasing sense of privacy from the drawing room, to the dining room and study, to the "lady's room" with its raised sitting area, which occupies the center. But the window of this space looks onto the living space. Suspended in the middle of the house, this space assumes both the character of a "sacred" space and of a point of control. Upon entering a Loos interior one's body is continually turned around to face the space one just moved through, rather than the upcoming space or the space outside. With each turn, each return look, comfort is paradoxically produced by two seemingly opposing conditions, intimacy and control.
