<p>The MÃ¼ller House (Prague) - Adolf Loos</p>
<h4>Raumplan versus Plan Libre</h4>


<p>
- The Domestic Scene<br><br>
There is an interior in the detective novel. But can there be a detective story of the interior itself, of the hidden mechanisms by which space is constructed as interior? Which may be to say, a detective story of detection itself, of the controlling look, the look of control, the controlled look. But where would the traces of the look be imprinted?<br><br>
The inhabitants of Loos' houses are both actors in and spectators of the family scene-involved in, yet detached from, their own space. In every Loos house there is a point of maximum tension and it always coincides with a threshold or boundary. Architecture is not simply a platform that accommodates the viewing subject. It is a viewing mechanism that produces the subject. It precedes and frames its occupant. The house is the stage for the theater of the family, a place where people are born and live and die.
