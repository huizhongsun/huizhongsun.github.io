<p>Golconda - Rene Magritte</p>
<h4>An Illusion or A Truth</h4>
<p>
- Representation and Reproduction<br><br>
Magritte was fascinated by the seductiveness of images. Ordinarily, you see a picture of something and you believe in it, you are seduced by it; you take its honesty for granted. But Magritte knew that representations of things can lie. These images of men aren't men, just pictures of them, so they don't have to follow any rules. This painting is fun, but it also makes us aware of the falsity of representation.
