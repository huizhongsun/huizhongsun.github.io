<p>Maison Cook - Le Corbusier</p>

<h4>Raumplan versus Plan Libre</h4>


<p>
- Five Points<br><br>
The 5 Points are clearly emphasised in the Maison cook, with the piloti as a central point set back from the façade level "dramatizing the separation of structure from external cladding". The use of the piloti provides a passage below the house for both pedestrian and cars. Use of the continuous windows draws attention to the free façade and also contains a roof garde on top which replaces the green area used by the building. The curved partitions dramatize the "free plan", catch the light, and stand like objects in the lucid space; inevitably they call to mind the bottles and guitars of Purist pictures.
