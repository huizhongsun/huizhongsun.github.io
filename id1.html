<h4>Data Diaries - Cory Arcangel</h4>
<p>
Data Diaries is 11 hours of video footage which was generated by tricking Quicktime into thinking the RAM of a home computer is video. This was done once for each day in January 2003. Watch as Cory's emails, letters, webpages, DSL data, songs, and anything else he worked on that day float by as a totally-psyched attention deficit disorder 15 frames per second video experience.
