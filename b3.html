- A Theater Box<br><br>
"...The smallness of a theater box would be unbearable if one could not look out into the large space beyond." <br><br>
In the Moller house, there is a raised sitting area off the living room with a sofa set against the window. Although one cannot see out the window, its presence is strongly felt. A sense of security is produced by the position of the couch, the placement of its occupants, against the light. Anyone who, ascending the stairs from the entrance, enters the living room, would take a few moments to recognize a person sitting in the couch. Conversely, any intrusion would soon be detected by a person occupying this area, just as an actor entering the stage is immediately seen by a spectator in a theater box.
