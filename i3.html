<p>Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 - Marcel Duchamp</p>
<h4>An Illusion or A Truth</h4>
<p>
- Motion in the Picture<br><br>
The discernible "body parts" of the figure are composed of nested, conical and cylindrical abstract elements, assembled together in such a way as to suggest rhythm and convey the movement of the figure merging into itself. The question of whether the figure represents a human body remains unanswered; the figure provides no clues to its age, individuality, or character, while the gender of "nu" is male.
