<h4>Pale Blue Dot</h4>

<p>



Pale Blue Dot is a photograph of planet Earth taken on February 14, 1990, by the Voyager 1 space probe from a record distance of about 6 billion kilometers. Voyager 1, which had completed its primary mission and was leaving the Solar System, was commanded by NASA to turn its camera around and take one last photograph of Earth. In the photograph, the planet appears as a tiny dot against the vastness of space, among bands of sunlight.
