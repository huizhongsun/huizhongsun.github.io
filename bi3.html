<p>The Metropolis of Tomorrow - Hugh Ferriss</p>

<h4>Unbuilt Architecture</h4>

<p>
	

	Ferriss never designed a single noteworthy building, but after his death a colleague said “he influenced my generation of architects more than any other man.” With The Metropolis of Tomorrow it’s easy to see why. It’s beautiful with idealistic and poetically expressed ideas about the then current state of urban architecture and a fond hope that architects to come would put concept, human experience, and emotional response before mere capitalistic considerations.
