Arcangel transcoded this raw material into a new format, the QuickTime video, using the constraints of viewing over a 56k modem to define the size and bitrate of each file. To emphasize the arbitrariness of this conversion process, Arcangel generated two videos from each set of dataâ€”color and black-and-white. In the resulting clips, geometric blocks appear in fluctuating densities on a solid background, accompanied by a soundtrack of digital noise.
