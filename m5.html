<h4> From Linear to Nonlinear  </h4>

<p>
- Chaos<br><br>
	Small differences in initial conditions yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems  rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general. This happens even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable. Chaos Theory deals with nonlinear things that are effectively impossible to predict or control, like turbulence, weather, the stock market, our brain states.
