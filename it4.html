<h4>The Unreliable Archivist</h4>
<p>
		- Janet Cohen, Keith Frank, and Jon Ippolito<br><br>
When the archive is opened, oddity is what expels from it. There is a grainy screen with a small image and off to the left are a collection of sliders. The sliders decide whether the object being affected will be plain, enigmatic, loaded, or preposterous. This can change anything from the background to the words that caption the images. And as one can guess, the things being changed go from believable to just downright weird.There is an apparent deviation in the interpretation between texts and images.
