- Copy and paste across devices <br><br>
With Universal Clipboard, you can copy text, images, photos, and videos on one Apple device and then paste the content on another Apple device. For example, you can copy a recipe you found browsing the web on your Mac then paste it into a grocery list in Notes on your nearby iPhone.<br>
Note: To use Universal Clipboard, your devices must meet Continuity system requirements. They must also have Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Handoff turned on in System Preferences (on your Mac) and in Settings (on your iOS devices).
