"A proposition is a picture of reality.<br>
A proposition is a model of reality as we imagine it." ［4.01］<br><br>

"At first sight a proposition--one set out on the printed page, for example--does not seem to be a picture of the reality with which it is concerned. But neither do written notes seem at first sight to be a picture of a piece of music . . . And yet these sign-languages prove to be pictures, even in the ordinary sense, of what they represent." ［4.011］<br><br>

"A gramophone record, the musical idea, the written notes, and the sound-waves, all stand to one another in the same internal relation of depicting that holds between language and the world.<br>

They are all construed according to a common logical pattern." ［4.014］<br><br>

"My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them--as steps--to climb up beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.)<br>

He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright." ［6.54］
