<h4>A Metaphor</h4>

"A proposition is a picture of reality.
A proposition is a model of reality as we imagine it." ［4.01］<br><br>

"A gramophone record, the musical idea, the written notes, and the sound-waves, all stand to one another in the same internal relation of depicting that holds between language and the world.

They are all construed according to a common logical pattern." ［4.014］<br><br>

"My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them--as steps--to climb up beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.)

He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright." ［6.54］<br><br>
