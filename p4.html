<h4>Body and Mind in a Place</h4>

<p>
For Heidegger, space is not something that can be known apart from things, but only by their relation to other things.  We should see a "locale" as being created by the presence of an object within it - the "locale" of a particular stretch of river bank "comes into existence only by virtue of the bridge". "Accordingly, spaces receive their essential being from locales and not from 'space'(being a mere abstraction that can be translated anywhere)"
