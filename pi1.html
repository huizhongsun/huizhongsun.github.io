<h4>Cinema 1: The Movement Image - Gilles Deleuze</h4>


<p>
	- A Slice of the World

Deleuze's theory is about how the cinema works as apparatus and how it helps us to theorize perception and to think about "the image" as an idea or concept.<br><br>


For each aspect of the world is a reflection-refraction of all the rest, it is a foregrounding of some parts of the universe over others, a framing. Cinema is worldslicing. It is framing a part of the flowing matter of the universe, and then connecting that with others.<br><br>



The universe is nothing but a crystal of images, reflecting and refracting each other. Each entity, by slicing the universe up in its own way, produces its own cinema, framing and cutting, slicing and imaging, producing perception-images of movement-images. When these lead to negotiations between multiple potential states, these perception-images lead to affection-images, which can lead to distinctions, or action-images, images of action-distinction. As we get closer to time-images, we see how difference in the image is precisely what time is. <br><br>
Images can be infinitely divided and redivided. And hence, there are infinite potential combinations and recombinations.
