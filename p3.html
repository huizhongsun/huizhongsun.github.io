<h4>Body and Mind in a Place</h4>

<p>
For Theodor Lipps, there were two kinds of seeing, optical,  which was concerned with matter, and aesthetic, which was concerned with what was left after matter was removed. Space was this dematerialized object. "The beauty of spatial forms is my ability to live out an ideal sense of free movement in it. Opposed to this is the ugly form, where I am not able to do this."
