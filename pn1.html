<h4>Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison - Michel Foucault  </h4>


<p>
Foucault paints a picture of contemporary society that sometimes resembles George Orwell's 1984. He explores the ways that government has claimed ever greater control over and enforcement of ever more private aspects of our lives by new technological advancements(the internet, telephones, cell phones, social security numbers, the census, ATMs, credit cards, and the ever increasing number of surveillance cameras in urban spaces). <br><br>To maintain order in a democratic and capitalist society, the populace needs to believe that any person could be surveilled at any time. In time, such a structure would ensure that the people would soon internalize the panoptic tower and police themselves. <br><br>
It is a type of location of bodies in space, of distribution of individuals in relation to one another, of hierarchical organization, of disposition of centres and channels of power, of definition of the instruments and modes of intervention of power. Whenever one is dealing with a multiplicity of individuals on whom a task or a particular form of behaviour must be imposed, the panoptic schema may be used.
