<h4>Literal or Phenomenal</h4>

<p>

Transparency may be an inherent quality of substance, as in a glass curtain wall; or it may be an inherent quality of organization. One can, for this reason, distinguish between a literal and a phenomenal transparency. <br>

In the defining of literal and phenomenal transparency, a coherence is shown in the interpretation of an image and a building.
