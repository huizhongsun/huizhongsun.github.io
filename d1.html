<h4>Multidimensional</h4>

	In order to perform any type of statistical data analysis, one organized their data into a data matrix (2D grid of numbers - 2-way array). The above picture shows the difference in organizing a set of images as a data matrix vs. a data tensor. Note, that each image was vectorized into a column of numbers, but displayed for visualization purposes as a 2D image.<br>

Multilinear tensor methods, as opposed to a linear data tensor decompositions, explicitly model an image in terms of statistical information associated with each causal factor.
