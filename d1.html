<h4>Multidimensional</h4>
<p>
	Scalars are single numbers and are an example of a 0th-order tensor. <br><br>
	Vectors are ordered arrays of single numbers and are an example of 1st-order tensor.<br><br>
	Matrices are rectangular arrays consisting of numbers and are an example of 2nd-order tensors.<br><br>
	The more general entity of a tensor encapsulates the scalar, vector and the matrix. In machine learning, and deep learning in particular, a 3rd-order tensor can be used to describe the intensity values of multiple channels (red, green and blue) from a two-dimensional image.
