<h4>A Metaphor</h4>
<p>  
- Words: Linear Space<br><br> 
It is in the nature of language that words have to be spoken or written in a linear sequence. It depicts a sequential motion. When people talk about reading something, what they are generally doing is projecting imagined bodily movement in a scene, and describing what they would encounter, they are performing a linear act of interpretation.
