	- Social Media<br><br>
Social media are computer-mediated technologies that facilitate the creation and sharing of information, ideas, career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks. Social media operate in a dialogic transmission system (many sources to many receivers). The followers and likes are the new social boundary, creating a collective gaze that sometimes pushes users to behave differently.
