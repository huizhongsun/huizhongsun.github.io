<p>
Usually unseen by the user, RAM is used by personal computers as temporary storage. When it is viewed in an editor, glimpses of legible fragments of information (emails received, websites visited) may be found among inscrutable strings of machine code. This digital detritus, co-authored by the computer and its user, forms the raw material of Data Diaries.
