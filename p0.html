<h4>Body and Mind in a Place</h4>

<p>
As well as being a physical property of dimension or extent, "space" is also a property of the mind, part of the apparatus through which we perceive the world.
The German word for space, Raum, at once signifies both a material enclosure, a "room", and a philosophical concept.<br><br>

For Kant, space exists "in the mind a priori...as a pure intuition, in which all objects must be determined".
